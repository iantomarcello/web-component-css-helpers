## Deprecation Notice - August 2023
Much is deprecated with changes and improvements in CSS.

---
CSS mixins or utilities as JavaScript. <br>
Mostly to work with template literals, Web Components and Lit Elements.

<s>Probably will be obsolete if and/or when there's a way to use CSS LESS or
SASS mixins in Web Components semantically without embed of external links,
which would be nice. </s>
